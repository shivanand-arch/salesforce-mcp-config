This project provides Salesforce MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for AI coding assistants.

## Salesforce Org Details
- **Org Alias**: ameyo
- **Org URL**: https://ameyo.my.salesforce.com
- **Toolsets Enabled**: orgs, data, metadata, users

## Revenue Definition (TWO sources)

### 1. Reported Revenue (actual revenue recognized)
When asked about "revenue", "reported revenue", "actual revenue":
- **Object**: `accounts_revenue__c`
- **Value Field**: `Revenue_Booked_Amount__c` (Label: "Reported Rev Amount")
- **Date Field**: `Revenue_Booked_On__c`
- **Cluster/Sector**: `Cluster__c` (directly on this object)
- Other useful fields: `SKU__c`, `Products__c`, `Region__c`, `Classification__c`, `Revenue_Classification__c`, `Account__c`, `Customer_Name__c`, `CSM__c`, `Account_Manager__c`, `Norm_Rev_Amount__c`

### 2. Order Bookings (deals won on Opportunity)
When asked about "bookings", "order value", "deals won":
- **Object**: Opportunity
- **Stage Filter**: `StageName IN ('Order', 'POC')`
- **Date Field**: `B_Deal_Date__c` (NOT CloseDate)
- **Value Field**: `Net_New_INR__c` (formula, already in INR)
- `Net_New__c` — Raw net new value (DOUBLE, set by Finance)

### Default: Use `accounts_revenue__c` for revenue questions unless user specifically asks about deals/bookings/pipeline.

## Sector / Vertical Mapping
When asked about a "sector" (e.g., Retail, BFSI, Healthcare):
- **On `accounts_revenue__c`**: Use `Cluster__c`
- **On Opportunity**: Use `Account_Cluster__c` (or `Account.Cluster__c`)
- **NOT** `Account.Industry` or `Account.Cohort_Industry__c`
- Sub-sector detail: use `Account.Sub_Cluster__c`

### Retention Metrics Structure (from accounts_revenue__c, Tableau-validated)
- **NRR** (Net Revenue Retention): Current period revenue / Preceding period revenue (including upsell/cross-sell)
- **GRR** (Gross Revenue Retention): Current period revenue / Preceding period revenue (excluding expansion)
- **Net GPR** (Net Gross Profit Retention): Same as NRR but using GP__c
- **Gross GPR** (Gross Gross Profit Retention): Same as GRR but using GP__c
- Rolling 3M, Rolling 12M, YTD variants available
- Keyholes: Regional, Cluster, SKU breakdowns

### Cluster Categories (from Cluster Dashboard tabs)
FM Funded-I, FM Funded-II & Traditional-II, Traditional-I, SME Funded, BFSI & Strategic Large, APAC, ME, Africa

## SOQL Tips
- Multipicklist fields (`Product_Type__c`, `Type_of_Solution__c`) require `INCLUDES` operator, NOT `LIKE`
- `Description` field cannot be filtered with `LIKE` in SOQL
- `Subject` field cannot be used in `GROUP BY`
- Cannot use alias names in `ORDER BY` — use the aggregate function directly (e.g., `ORDER BY COUNT(Id) DESC`)
- Won stage = `'Order'` (not 'Closed Won')

## CRM Buddy Document Comparison (March 2026)

The CRM Buddy Document (`AI_Revenue_Controller.cls` + `CrmBuddy` LWC) uses BigQuery + Gemini for analytics. Its field-level mappings are stored dynamically in BigQuery tables (`AI_Schema_Registry`, `AI_Mapping_Dictionary`, `AI_Analytics_Rules`, etc.) — not in the document itself.

### Patterns imported from CRM Buddy into Ask Salesforce:

| # | Pattern | Source (CRM Buddy) | Status |
|---|---------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | Personal vs org-wide detection ("my"/"I"/"me" → owner filter) | Lines 424-430, 529 | ✅ Imported to SOQL prompt |
| 2 | "No single number" mandate (always include dimensional breakdowns) | Lines 436-438 | ✅ Imported to SOQL prompt |
| 3 | Currency formatting (₹X.XX L for Lakhs, ₹X.XX Cr for Crores) | Line 544, 672-686 | ✅ Imported to Summary prompt |
| 4 | Pipeline aging thresholds (🔴>120d, 🟡60-120d, 🟢<60d) | Lines 721-731 | ✅ Imported to Summary prompt |
| 5 | Root cause analysis for "why" questions | Lines 854-871 | ✅ Imported to Summary prompt |
| 6 | Response scaling (micro vs macro questions) | Lines 546-550 | ✅ Imported to Summary prompt |
| 7 | Zero data graceful handling | Lines 566-573 | ✅ Imported to Summary prompt |
| 8 | Top/bottom performer indicators (🟢🔴) | Lines 540-541 | ✅ Imported to Summary prompt |

### Already aligned (no changes needed):

| # | Pattern | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | FY/Quarter rules (Apr-Mar, Q1-Q4) | Both systems use same definitions |
| 2 | Domain routing (Revenue vs Opportunity keywords) | Already in REVENUE DEFINITION section |
| 3 | Self-healing query retry | Both systems have retry loops |
| 4 | Chat history context | Both pass conversation context |
| 5 | Won stage = 'Order' | Consistent across both |

### Not imported (architectural differences):

| # | Pattern | Reason |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | Executive memory (stores insights in BigQuery) | Requires BigQuery infrastructure |
| 2 | Dynamic schema registry from BigQuery | We use hardcoded prompt (more reliable for SOQL) |
| 3 | Follow-up question suggestions | Requires LWC changes |
| 4 | HTML-only response format (no Markdown) | Our LWC renders Markdown correctly |
| 5 | 5-section analysis structure (☕🏆📉📊🧠) | Too prescriptive; our flexible format works better |

### Tableau Validation (March 2026)

All 10 CRM Buddy patterns above were **CONFIRMED** against actual Tableau metadata extracted via Metadata GraphQL API from 12 workbooks. The Tableau data validates:
- Revenue/GP fields match CRM Buddy's field references (Revenue_Booked_Amount__c, GP__c)
- Retention NRR/GRR calculation pattern (two-period comparison) matches Tableau Retention dashboard
- Penetration metrics (ACI/API/PPI/GPI) confirmed via Penetration Index workbook
- Target vs Actual patterns confirmed via Variance Analysis workbook (uses Accounts_Target__c, Booking_Target__c)
- 7 of 17 original dashboard mappings had deviations — now corrected with Tableau-validated sources
- 6 new SF objects discovered: Accounts_Target__c, Booking_Target__c, Program__c, Opp_Related_Programs__c, OB_to_Revenue__c, Lead_Backup__c
